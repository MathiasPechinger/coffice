# Digital Coffee List - COffice

This project was developed to get rid of the paper based analog version of tracking the coffee and other beverages. (Naming: Coffee + Office = COffice)

The names and values in the table are examples ;)

## Usage
Click the name and the Bevarge. Finally click on Drink and you are good to go.

## Installation

- The php script is running using XAMPP. Install the XAMPP Server and place the repo inside the following folder:
C:\xampp\htdocs\coffice

- Rename "user_data template.csv" to "user_data.csv"

- After XAMPP is started you can browse "localhost:8080/coffice" on your local machine. 

## Trouble shooting 
Make sure to setup the right port in XAMPP. In our example this is 8080.
Check the local path to the csv file and make sure to rename it to "user_data.csv".
